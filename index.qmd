::: {#hero-heading}
PhD Speech and Language Sciences\
Newcastle University
:::

I am at the end of my PhD in the department of Speech and Language Sciences (SLS) at Newcastle University (UK). Currently, I am also covering the lectures on Advanced Statistics for SLS Stage 3 Research Methods. I completed my PhD thesis in October 2025, investigating the relationship between acoustic cues and phonetic learning in adult second language (L2) acquisition. Specifically, I tested the effect of a cue-weighting-approach intervention in the perceptual learning of non-native lexical tones based on selective attention theories.

More broadly, I am interested in understanding how human brains decode the rich and complex speech signals to access information. For example, how are acoustic signals from different speakers in various contexts perceived and processed by the brain as meaningful units, such as speech sounds or emotion? What are the relationships between these diverse acoustic dimensions —— are some weighted more than others for effective processing? If there is an underlying rule for cue weighting, is it relatively stable across different tasks, stages, and conditions? What factors contribute to this rule, and how does it affect learning and other life applications such as in medical treatment and aging?

I have a real passion in using experimental and quantitative methods, including both behavioural and neurological methods. I also encourage open and reproducible research workflow.
