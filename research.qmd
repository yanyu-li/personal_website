## Themes

### Speech timing and rhythm

I study how segments and syllables coordinate in time and how rhythm emerges from speech production and perception.

### Prosody and intonation

My work examines how pitch patterns interact with duration and intensity to mark prominence and structure.

### Experimental phonology

I use production and perception experiments to test models of timing, rhythm, and prosodic encoding.

### Computational modeling

I build statistical and dynamical models to connect surface patterns with underlying representations.
