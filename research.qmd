## Themes

My research interests span a range of topics within psycholinguistics, although the main focus is on the study of speech sounds, and in particular speech perception, from a variety of intersecting perspectives, including:

- Auditory processing, e.g., categorisation.
- The relationship between acoustics and higher levels representation, e.g., acoustic-phonetic mapping, acoustics-emotion mapping.
- Learning mechanisms, e.g., statistical learning.
- Language acquisition, including L1 and L2 acquisition.  


### Auditory processing


### Second Language (L2) acquisition

I study how segments and syllables coordinate in time and how rhythm emerges from speech production and perception.

### Speech perception

My work examines how listeners decode and learn prosodic information through acoustic cues. 

### Research methods

I use experimental and quantitative methods to investigate
